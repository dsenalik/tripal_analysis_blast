# Overview
This module extends Tripal for display of BLAST local alignments on gene, mRNA or protein pages.  This module is compatible with both Tripal v2 and Tripal v3.  It provides:

1.  An importer for loading BLAST XML results created using the NCBI blast program.  Data is loaded into Chado and BLAST results are automatically associated with genes, mRNA (transcripts) or proteins.
2.  Blast results appear on each feature page via an interactive viewer and a tabular list (see screenshot for example).
